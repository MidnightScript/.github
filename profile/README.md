### uygununubul.com:
A cutting-edge platform that consolidates property listings, including houses, cars, and more, from multiple commercial websites. Utilizing advanced AI algorithms, it recommends the best options tailored to specific user preferences and requirements.

- A sophisticated scoring algorithm will be developed to address the filtration problem, ensuring the best selection of listings.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) will be employed to identify the best-fitting results for user needs after filtration.
- All reports will be stored and utilized for future machine learning processes, continuously improving the recommendation system.

### DriveGuard:
A device that continuously monitors driver behavior to detect careless actions. Upon determining the nature and frequency of these actions, it generates detailed reports. The device utilizes a Raspberry Pi and a camera with OpenCV image processing to monitor:

- Eye blinking count
- Body and head position
- Elapsed time the driver is not looking in the correct direction
- Emotions such as anger, tiredness, drowsiness, and more

This data will contribute to future research articles and assist drivers in understanding and improving their driving habits. In emergency situations, the device can emit a loud noise to alert the driver and help them regain focus.
